                <h1 class="center-text">Who Is Sonic?</h1>
                <h2 class="center-text GreenYellowFont">Sonic the Hedgehog is one of the most popular video game characters ever created, and was made by Yuji Naka. Sonic and the franchise's characters are owned by SEGA, and Sonic is their mascot. His first appearance was a cameo in 1991, when he was a character in Rad Mobile, a racing game made by SEGA. The first game dedicated to him was created in 1993, with him starring as the main playable character. His defining characteristic is his intense speed. His game series started on the Sega Genesis, but eventually branched out to many more consoles, including SEGA's own consoles and when they stopped making their own consoles, third-party consoles as well. His most common sidekick throughout his adventures is Tails, a flying two-tailed fox.</h2>
