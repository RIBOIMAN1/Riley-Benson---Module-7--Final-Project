                <h1 class="center-text">Who Are My Mains in Smash?</h1>
                <h3 class="center-text GreenBorderedTextRounded">This mainly covers Smash Ultimate, however other games I play will be briefly mentioned as well.</h3>
                <h2 class="center-text GreenYellowFont">I main a weird selection of characters in Smash Ultimate. The characters I main are King K. Rool and Sonic.</h2>
                <h2 class="center-text GreenYellowFont">K. Rool is a slower heavyweight character who likes to hit hard and use his zoning tools to pressure opponents into doing risky options and then racking on a ton of damage against his opponents. He also has really big attacks, making them easy to hit when they are not challenged effectively. With a weight stat of 133, he is the second heaviest character in the game. He is currently listed as the 3rd worst of 89 characters in the game, making him a E+ tier and considered as a bottom tier. This can be attributed to his somewhat slow speed and frame data, heavy weight, and big body, which are quite negative qualities at high level play since a bigger body and heavier weight means that you are very easy to combo, and his movement and attack speed being fairly slow result in him being unable to get an attack out or escape his opponent's combos. I use him as a slightly less serious character who I happen to still do really well with.</h2>
                <h2 class="center-text GreenYellowFont">Sonic on the other hand, is a very fast lightweight character who sports both a strong offense and especially strong defense. His game plan is known to be extremely taxing on the opponent, as he likes to control the match in his favor by slowing it down and playing extremely defensive. In other words, he uses his speed as a means to slow down the game, wait for the opponent to make the first decision, and immediately be ready to punish that decision. People typically don't like fighting against Sonic for that very reason. With a weight stat of 89, he is not quite a featherweight character but he is a lightweight. He is currently ranked as the 2nd best of 89 characters in the game, making him one of only two characters in the S+ tier and considered a top tier. Because he is quite a lot better of a character than King K. Rool at a higher level, he is the one I take more seriously on competitively, and is a character that I also have more room for improvement with my gameplay.</h2>
                <h2 class="center-text">Other characters that I play for fun in Smash Ultimate that I'm good with but don't main are: Terry, Link, Ganondorf, Little Mac, Pyra / Mythra, and Captain Falcon.</h2>
                <h2 class="center-text">In addition, I also play other Smash games, too. These games are: Smash 64, Smash Melee, Smash Brawl, Smash 4, Project +, and the other game that I play the most, Super Smash Flash 2, a Smash Bros. fan game. In each of the following games, I main:</h2>
